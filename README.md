In this work, I used a dataset that has information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil 
and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 
I selected this dataset because this is a current issue that happens here in Brazil. 
Another factor is that the scholarship (Bolsa Fam√≠lia) raises several discussions about 
its effectiveness and I am interested to discover whether people that receive this 
scholarship are more prone to don't miss an appointment or not.  

Other things that I want to discover by investigating this dataset is whether:  
- age is an important factor; 
- men have more no show to appointments than women; 
- a person with a disease or special condition tend to not miss the appointment or not; 
- the strategy to send an SMS to remember the appointment works or not.
